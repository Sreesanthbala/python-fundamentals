# Conditional Statements :
# CS in python allows us to execute the block of code based on certain conditions.
# We can use if, elif, else and nested statements in python.

# These CS includes:
# 1. if statement - executes a block of code if a condition is true.
# 2. if-else statement - executes one block if True, another block if it is False
# 3. if-elif-else statement - checks multiple conditions sequentially
# 4. nested if statement - one if inside another

# Syntax as follows :

# if statement
    # if condition:
    #     # code to be executed if condition is true

# if-else statement :
    # if condition:
    #     # code to be executed if condition is true
    # else:
    #     # code to be executed if condition is false

# if-elif-else statement :
    # if condition1:
    #     # code to be executed if condition1 is true
    # elif condition2:
    #     # code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
    # else:
    #     # code to be executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false

# Nested if statement :
# if condition1:
#     if condition2:
#         # code to be executed if both conditions are true
#     else:
#         # code to be executed if condition1 is true and condition2 is false
# else:
#     # code to be executed if condition1 is false


# if True:
#     print("Condition is true")
#     if True:
#         print("Condition inside if is true")
#     else:
#         print("Condition inside if is false")
# else:
#     print("Condition is false")
