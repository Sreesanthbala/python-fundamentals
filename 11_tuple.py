# Tuple :
# Tuple in python is used to store the collection of items into one single variable.
# Tuple is denoted by round brackets () and items are separated by comma(,).
# Tuple is ordered collection of items which means item in tuple has index number.
# Tuple is immutable which means tuple can not be modified after it is created.
# Tuple allows Duplicate values.


# Tuple :
# A tuple is collection which is:
# 1. Ordered
# 2. Immutable
# 3. Indexed
# 4. Allow duplicate values
# 5. Allow heterogeneous values
# 6. Allow null values
# 7. Allow empty values



# Why Tuples :
# 1. Tuples are faster than lists
# 2. Tuples are more memory efficient than lists
# 3. Tuples use less memory than lists
# 4. Tuples are immutable, so they can't be changed
# 5. Tuples are used for fixed data like days, months..etc




# Methods :
# 1. count() : Returns the number of occurrences of the specified value.
# 2. index() : Returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value.
# 3. len() : Returns the number of items in the tuple.
# 4. max() : Returns the largest item in the tuple.
# 5. min() : Returns the smallest item in the tuple.
# 6. sorted() : Returns a new sorted list from the elements of the tuple.
# 7. tuple() : Returns a tuple created from the specified iterable or object.
# 8. reversed() : Returns a reverse iterator, yielding elements in the reverse order.
